# My Blogs

## About

This is a temporary site for my blog page on [mofii.net](http://mofii.net).

Update: I don't want to spend too much time on all the front-end work and Flask management. So I am going to host the blogs on github.io for now.

> This is a collection of interesting articles saved for future blogs. [here](saved.md)
