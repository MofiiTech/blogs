# Learning Machine Learning and More

## About the blog

After taking the introductory course on Coursera by Andrew Ng, I found machine learning so fascinating and I've decided to change all my plans for this summer (Flask, JavaScript, RoR, ...). However, there are so many resources that it's really hard to find those really good for me. So I'm going to write down the books I'm reading and the resources I find helpful in this blog. Have fun.
